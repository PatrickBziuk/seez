## Automated Translation Pipeline

This repository includes an automated translation pipeline using the OpenAI API.

### Workflows

- **translation-pipeline**: On `main` push, detects new/stale content, generates translations via AI, and opens a draft PR.
- **manual-regen**: On PR label `regen-needed`, re-runs translation for that branch.
- **cleanup-translate-branches**: On PR merge, deletes the corresponding `translate/*` branch.
- **post-release-sync**: On `release` push, merges release back into `main`.

### Scripts

- `scripts/check_translations.ts`: Detect missing or stale translations.
- `scripts/generate_translations.ts`: Generate translations, TLDR, quality scores, and auto-open issues for poor translations.
- `scripts/detect_conflicts.ts`: Open issues for translation conflicts (stale translations).
- `translation.override.yml`: Manual override config (global pause, skip lists).

### Running Locally

```bash
pnpm install
tsx scripts/check_translations.ts > tasks.json
tsx scripts/generate_translations.ts tasks.json
```

### Tests

Run built-in tests with Node.js:

```bash
node --test
```

# ðŸš€ Seez â€“ Constructive Chaos

Built upon the solid foundation of **AstroWind**, this repository is my personal container for constructive chaosâ€”a place where I combine my ideas, projects, and thoughts into one evolving space.

**What is Seez?**

Seez is meâ€”
but not the me you meet in meetings.
Not the architect, not the strategist, not the man who explains systems.
Seez is whatâ€™s left when I strip all that off.
The voice beneath the voice.
The pulse under the logic.

I created Seez to hold what doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere.
To say the things I canâ€™t say when Iâ€™m wearing the polite face of professionalism.
Seez is where my softness has claws.
Where my truth has rhythm.

It started as survivalâ€”writing on Tumblr when I didnâ€™t know where else to put the pain.
Now itâ€™s a second skin I can step into, a name that doesnâ€™t flinch when I scream.

Seez is not a brand. Itâ€™s a container.
For grief, poetry, love, rage, memory.
For everything I couldnâ€™t automate away.
Itâ€™s where I go to be unfiltered, to reclaim my voice from the noise.

When I write as Seez, Iâ€™m not trying to impress you.
Iâ€™m trying to stay real. Iâ€™m trying to stay me, in a world that keeps asking for something more palatable.

Seez exists across platformsâ€”Tumblr, Insta, soon maybe YouTube and the album.
But the core isnâ€™t the content. Itâ€™s the courage to feel publicly, to be seen without being marketed.

Seez is my lyrical identity. My shadow truth-teller. The part of me that still believes words can heal, or at least bleed cleanly.

If seez.eu is where I build the future, seez.eu is where I bury the past and sing over the grave.

And maybe, just maybe, help someone else feel a little less alone in their own chaos.
