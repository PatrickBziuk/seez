    Goal: Performance, GDPR-compliant data ownership, and usability for SMEs/NGOs/freelancers without lock-in."

## Why Portique Exists

Small and medium-sized European businesses, NGOs, and independent creators are caught between:

- US-based proprietary platforms with data sovereignty risks,
- DIY complexity of maintaining a modern deployment stack,
- Expensive agency lock-ins that trade control for superficial convenience.

Portique offers a third path:  
**The same technological foundation** as modern Jamstack platforms, but **fully transparent, self-hostable, or managed by a trusted European operator**. The architecture is auditable, reproducible, and built for long-term independence.

> **Note:** Self-hosting provides maximum control at the cost of operational overhead. Managed mode offers the exact same stack as a service — nothing hidden, nothing gated.

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Data Sovereignty & GDPR First.** All infrastructure is EU-based, with no hidden data exposure or US-Cloud dependencies (CLOUD Act aware).
2. **Jamstack DX, but FOSS.** Astro + Vite for builds, CI/CD with Woodpecker, Git-backed content via Gitea — fully transparent and vendor-neutral.
3. **Dual Operation Modes:**  
     - *Managed*: A European provider handles build, deployment, updates, and monitoring.  
     - *Self-hosted*: Same stack, self-operated, fully reproducible with IaC or containers.
4. **Progressive Onboarding:** Start with static hosting; expand into visual editors, Supabase-backed backends, and AI support assistants.

## Architecture Overview

Portique is a **CI/CD-powered static site hosting platform** with optional "backend-light" features and a dashboard/editor for non-technical users.

### Components

- **Astro + Vite**: Lightning-fast builds with modular architecture.
- **Gitea**: Git-forge for repo control and content editing — full ownership.
- **Woodpecker CI**: Runs `astro build`, deploys to Caddy or Bunny.net, handles cache invalidation.
- **Caddy**: Origin server with auto-HTTPS, reverse proxying.
- **Bunny.net**: CDN/edge storage for global static delivery.
- **Supabase (optional)**: Auth, database, file storage, functions — ideal for extending static sites with dynamic features.
- **Visual Editor & Dashboard**: Markdown-first with live preview, WYSIWYG planned.
- **AI Assistant (optional)**: Support, diagnostics, user onboarding (privacy-aware).

### Deployment Modes

#### 1. Managed European Deployment

A trusted provider offers:

- Full setup of Portique components
- CI/CD, TLS, backups, and monitoring
- Visual editor access and migration support

Clients receive the same Git-based workflow as self-hosting — without the sysadmin duties.

#### 2. Self-Hosted (DIY)

For tech-savvy teams:

- Fully reproducible via Proxmox, Docker, or Ansible/Terraform
- Control over secrets, scaling, user roles, integrations
- Optionally contribute improvements or maintain forks

## Example Minimal Pipeline

### `.woodpecker.yml`

```yaml
pipeline:
    build:
        image: node:20
        commands:
            - npm ci
            - npx astro build
    deploy:
        image: curlimages/curl
        commands:
            - ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Caddyfile (Origin + Proxy)

```json
example.com {
    root * /var/www/example.com
    file_server
    encode zstd gzip
    tls you@example.com
}
```

### Supabase Client (Astro Integration)

```ts
// src/lib/supabaseClient.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

export const supabase = createClient(
    import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
    import.meta.env.PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);
```

### Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

- Isolated CI builds per tenant (containerized)
- Separate domain zones and asset storage (Bunny.net zones or directory-based)
- Resource limits enforced via cgroups or virtualization
- Per-customer dashboards and domain routing via Caddy

### UX, Editor & Observability

A central dashboard offers:

- Build logs, SSL status, domain management
- Support interface with AI assistance
- Content editing, deployment triggers, rollback controls

Markdown-based editing is the first step — future iterations will offer rich block editors and custom component previews.

### Security Principles

- Secrets stored via Woodpecker’s secret store
- 2FA and RBAC matching Gitea org/team roles
- Audit logs for all user actions (deployments, logins, domain changes)
- Sanitization of user-generated content in editor inputs

### Positioning & Market Strategy

Portique = Netlify-level developer experience + GDPR + ownership.

It targets:

- Freelancers (visual editor + easy deploys)
- NGOs (free or discounted plans)
- SMEs (managed deployment + sovereignty)
- Developers (self-hosted, auditable, modifiable)

Business models include:

- Managed Hosting Tiered Plans (based on users/projects/storage)
- Custom Onboarding/Migration packages
- Community Marketplace (themes, templates, components)

### Quickstart (Self-hosted)

- Provision a Linux VM (or container) with Gitea, Caddy, and Woodpecker CI
- Push an Astro repo to Gitea
- Configure `.woodpecker.yml` and deployment scripts
- Set up Bunny.net or Caddy as static host
- Configure TLS via Caddy (auto)
- Add Supabase if needed
- Optionally install the dashboard UI and visual editor frontend

### Contribution & Extension

Portique is open to contributions:

- Fork and self-host
- Submit plugins (editor blocks, deploy integrations)
- Share use cases and templates
- Build a managed offering for your region

### Roadmap

- **MVP:** Static hosting, CI/CD, custom domains
- **Phase 2:** Markdown editor + dashboard
- **Phase 3:** Supabase integrations, AI assistant
- **Phase 4:** Multi-tenant SaaS, community template marketplace
