📖 **TL;DR – Book Concept:**
Title Suggestion: “Light at the End of the Lines”

🧭 **Core Concept:**
A now 27-year-old author looks back at texts he wrote between the ages of 14 and 21 – poems, fragments, emotional monologues. He is writing a book about the attempt to write a book back then, taking readers on a literary-emotional journey through his own past.

Each chapter contains:

- old original texts (unfiltered)
- comments, reflections, emotional essays from today’s perspective
- reflections on trauma, love, writing, depression, and self-discovery

The book is both a product and a process – it shows how writing was once a rescue and today means insight.

🎯 **Target Audience:**

- Young adults (16–21): People still in the self-discovery phase, often struggling and feeling misunderstood
- New adults (21–29): People wanting to understand what happened to them in retrospect
- Young men with emotional depth, who are rarely seen in mainstream literature

💎 **USP – What Makes the Book Unique?**

1. **Authenticity through Original Texts**  
   No staged fiction, no smoothed retelling:  
   You read the real words of a teenager – raw, honest, vulnerable.  
   These texts carry a time capsule within them, as no invented character could write exactly like this.

2. **Dual Perspective – Young & Adult**  
   The work is reflection and retrospection in one –  
   The “then voice” speaks directly. The “now voice” responds – not condescending, but understanding.

3. **Meta-Level: The Book as a Process**  
   The reader accompanies not just a story, but the creation process of the book itself.  
   This ensures:  
   - emotional closeness  
   - literary depth  
   - structural recognizability

4. **Emotional Empowerment**  
   It shows:  
   - that darkness can be named  
   - that writing can be a survival tool  
   - that self-understanding often matures years later  
   - and that literature consists not of solutions, but of survival.
