# About Seez

I'm a digital architect passionate about creating meaningful connections between technology and human expression. My work spans across web development, content architecture, and building systems that help ideas flow seamlessly across languages and cultures.

## Philosophy & Approach

**Technology as an Extension of Thought**: I believe the best systems amplify human creativity rather than replace it. Every line of code should serve to make complex ideas more accessible and communication more authentic.

**Quality Through Automation**: By automating the tedious parts of content management, translation, and deployment, we free up mental space for what matters: crafting meaningful narratives and building genuine connections.

**Transparency & Ownership**: In an age of black-box algorithms and platform dependency, I champion open-source solutions, clear data ownership, and systems you can understand and control.

## Current Projects

### üèóÔ∏è **Seez Platform** (This Site)

A multilingual content management system built on Astro 5, featuring:

- AI-powered translation pipeline with human oversight
- Environmental impact tracking for AI usage
- Canonical content identity system
- Complete transparency in content creation and modification

### üåê **Portique**

European FOSS alternative to proprietary Jamstack hosts, offering:

- Self-hosted or managed static site hosting
- GDPR-compliant infrastructure
- Complete stack sovereignty
- EU-based operations

## Technical Expertise

**Languages & Frameworks**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Astro, React, Node.js, Python
**Content Systems**: Markdown/MDX, Git-based workflows, headless CMS integration
**Infrastructure**: Docker, CI/CD, European hosting solutions
**AI Integration**: OpenAI API, token optimization, hallucination detection

## Content Style

My writing focuses on:

- **Technical tutorials** that explain not just "how" but "why"
- **Project retrospectives** sharing lessons learned and honest failures
- **System design** thinking for content, code, and community
- **Multilingual considerations** in modern web development

## Languages

- **German**: Native speaker, cultural nuance expert
- **English**: Professional fluency, technical writing
- **Code**: Fluent in human-readable programming

## Connect & Collaborate

I'm always interested in conversations about:

- Sustainable web development practices
- Multilingual content strategy
- Open-source alternatives to proprietary platforms
- Ethical AI integration in creative workflows

Feel free to reach out through any of the channels above, or simply drop me a line if you're working on something interesting that aligns with building a more open, transparent, and human-centered web.
