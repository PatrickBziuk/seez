  The author describes the various names and identities he has worn throughout
  his life, and how each name reflects a facet of his personality. From
  professional roles to creative expressions, he shows how these names help him
  navigate the world and understand himself. Ultimately, he is a person who
  wears masks to survive and to sing.

I have worn many names.  
But none of them were a lie.  
Only mirrors—each captures a different light.

---

## 💼 seez

_The system builder. The interface between logic and the world._

**seez.eu** is where I carry my spine.  
IT, automation, Dynamics 365, technical consulting.  
It is my last name, my profession, the part of me,  
that understands structure as a kind of grace.

seez is the version of me that appears in client conversations  
and builds systems that do not collapse under human chaos.

It is truth. But not all of it.

---

## 🎤 Seez

_The voice I raised when I could not scream under my own name._

**seez.eu** is where I bleed.  
It has been my alias since the days of forums and Tumblr,  
a name that felt safer than the world did.

Seez is a poet with a blade between the lines.  
He sings where I once broke.  
He is raw, romantic, angry, gentle.  
He is a part of me that never wanted to be optimized.

Here lives my book.  
My album. My ghosts.  
And, if you are careful, your reflection.

## 🪶 zeilenliebe

_“The love for the lines.” A forward-looking past._

Born from a Tumblr blog with 15,000 followers—  
now reinterpreted as a **publisher** for radical honesty.

zeilenliebe is where stories grow into communities.  
A platform for lyrical survival.  
One day it could be more than me.  
A small publishing house. A collective. A movement.

But for now, it is the heartbeat beneath my book _Seelenstriptease_.

---

## 🌤 deinanker

_The public hand I offer._

Instagram & Threads. Quote tiles, gentle words,  
a space where others can find themselves in mine.

deinanker is the bridge.  
A harbor for those who do not yet know where to go,  
but want to feel held while they search.

---

## 🕳 keinanker

_The abyss that speaks._

This is my shadow archive.  
Dark thoughts, uncurated fragments,  
quotes that have hurt me enough to save.

Anonymous in feeling.  
A place not meant for the masses.  
But for those who _know_—  
that healing begins in the darkness.

---

## 🧪 Cosensai, marken., circles.

_Not startups. Not yet products.  
But rituals in the making._

Each of these projects is a thought experiment I have named:

- **Cosensai** – a self-hosted AI memory assistant.
- **marken.** – transparent fashion.
- **circles.** – social networks rebuilt around reality.

They live in the **laboratory** of seez.eu.  
Not ready yet. But growing.

---

## 🌀 Konstruktives Chaos

_The name I have not yet built—  
but already live in._

One day I will unite everything here:  
the technology, the poetry, the paradox.  
No brand. A philosophy.

For my life is not a split between identities.  
It is a **system of tensions**.  
Not resolved—but alive.

---

## Who am I?

A system in the making.  
A memory engine wrapped in skin.  
An author who writes to stay real.  
A developer who builds to stay healthy.  
A human,  
who wears masks, not to hide,  
but to survive—and to sing.

If you made it here,  
you were meant to.  
Welcome to the center.

_“I am not one, I am many.  
But all of them are true.  
And perhaps you and I will never know the complete picture.”_
