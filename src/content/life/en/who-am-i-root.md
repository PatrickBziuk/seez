I’ve gone by many names.  
But none of them were lies.  
Only mirrors—each catching a different light.

---

## 💼 seez  
_The system builder. The interface between logic and the world._

**seez.eu** is where I wear my spine.  
IT, automation, Dynamics 365, technical consulting.  
It’s my surname, my profession, the part of me  
that understands structure as a kind of mercy.

seez is the version of me that shows up in client meetings  
and builds systems that don’t collapse under human messiness.

It is truth. But not the whole of it.

## 🎤 Seez  
_The voice I raised when I couldn’t scream under my own name._

**seez.eu** is where I bleed.  
It’s my alias since the days of forums and Tumblr,  
a name that felt safer when the world wasn't.

Seez is a poet with a blade between the lines.  
He sings where I once broke.  
He’s raw, romantic, angry, soft.  
He’s a part of me that never wanted to be optimized.

This is where my book lives.  
My album. My ghosts.  
And, if you’re careful, your reflection.

## 🪶 zeilenliebe  
_“The love of lines.” A future-facing past._

Born from a Tumblr blog with 15,000 followers—  
now reimagined as a **publishing label** for radical honesty.

zeilenliebe is where stories grow into community.  
A platform for lyrical survival.  
One day, it might be more than me.  
A small press. A collective. A movement.

But for now, it’s the heartbeat beneath my book *Seelenstriptease*.

---

## 🌤 deinanker  
_The public hand I offer._

Instagram & Threads. Zitatkacheln, sanfte Worte,  
a space where others can find themselves in mine.

deinanker is the bridge.  
A harbor for those who don’t yet know where they’re going,  
but want to feel held while searching.

---

## 🕳 keinanker  
_The abyss that speaks._

This is my shadow archive.  
Dark thoughts, uncurated fragments,  
quotes that bruised me enough to save.

Anonymous in feel.  
A place not meant for the masses.  
But for the ones who *know*—  
that healing begins in darkness.

---

## 🧪 Cosensai, marken., circles.  
_Not startups. Not yet products.  
But rituals in the making._

Each of these projects is a thought experiment I gave a name:

- **Cosensai** – a self-hosted AI memory assistant.  
- **marken.** – transparent fashion.  
- **circles.** – social networks rebuilt around reality.

They live in the **lab space** of seez.eu.  
Not yet ready. But growing.

---

## 🌀 Constructive Chaos  
_The name I haven’t built yet—  
but already live inside._

One day, I’ll unify it all here:  
the tech, the poetry, the paradox.  
Not a brand. A philosophy.

Because my life isn’t a split between identities.  
It’s a **system of tensions**.  
Not resolved—but alive.

---

## So who am I?

A system in emergence.  
A memory engine wrapped in skin.  
An author who writes to stay real.  
A developer who builds to stay sane.  
A human being,  
who wears masks not to hide,  
but to survive—and to sing.

If you made it here,  
you were meant to.  
Welcome to the center.

_“I am not one, I am many.  
But all of them are true.
And maybe, you and I never get to know the full picture.”_
