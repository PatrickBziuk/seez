## New Task: Translation Pipeline Implementation (see plan-10016-translation-pipeline.md)

### Phase 1: Schema & Core Infrastructure
- [ ] **T16-001**: Extend content schema to support translation pipeline frontmatter fields (translationKey, original, translationHistory, ai_tldr, ai_textscore)
- [ ] **T16-002**: Create utility functions for SHA computation, language pairing, and frontmatter validation
- [ ] **T16-003**: Implement translation override mechanism (translation.override.yml and TRANSLATION_PAUSE support)
- [ ] **T16-004**: Set up token usage ledger system with daily 2M token cap and persistent storage

### Phase 2: Core Translation Scripts  
- [x] **T16-005**: Build check_translations.js script for detecting missing/stale translations with override respect
- [x] **T16-006**: Implement generate_translations.js with combined OpenAI prompt for translation + TLDR + scoring
- [x] **T16-007**: Create quality review system with automated issue creation for poor translations
- [x] **T16-008**: Add translation caching mechanism keyed by (sourceSha, targetLang)

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration & Workflows
- [x] **T16-009**: Create main-to-translate GitHub Action workflow with deduplication logic
- [x] **T16-010**: Implement draft PR creation/updating system with proper naming conventions
- [x] **T16-011**: Build post-release sync workflow to feed approved translations back to main
- [x] **T16-012**: Add automated bad translation detection and GitHub issue creation

### Phase 4: Branch Management & Release Flow
- [x] **T16-013**: Implement branching strategy (draft → main → translate/* → release) with proper cleanup
- [ ] **T16-014**: Create manual override workflow for human-only translation branches
- [ ] **T16-015**: Set up conflict resolution for stale translations and concurrent edits
- [ ] **T16-016**: Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, snapshot tests) and documentation

## ✅ COMPLETED: GitHub Actions Workflow Consolidation

### ✅ Phase 1: Workflow Analysis & Planning
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-001**: Analyze existing workflow files and identify consolidation opportunities
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-002**: Design new workflow structure following best practices
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-003**: Plan proper build → translation sequencing

### ✅ Phase 2: Main CI/CD Workflow Implementation  
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-004**: Create consolidated ci-cd.yml workflow replacing actions.yaml
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-005**: Implement proper job dependencies (translation only after successful build)
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-006**: Switch from pnpm to npm for better reliability
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-007**: Add proper error handling and GitHub issue creation on build failures

### ✅ Phase 3: Translation Workflow Separation
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-008**: Create dedicated translation.yml workflow called by main workflow
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-009**: Implement proper artifact handling between jobs
- [x] **T-GHACTIONS-010**: Add translation branch creation and PR management

### ✅ Phase 4: Manual & Cleanup Workflows
