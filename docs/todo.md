## âœ… MAJOR PROGRESS: Multilingual Navigation & Routing Fixed!

**What was completed:**
- âœ… Fixed translation keys in navigation.ts (Books, Projects, Lab, Life, About, Contact)
- âœ… Added missing German translations for all navigation items
- âœ… Created multilingual routes: `/[lang]/books`, `/[lang]/projects`, `/[lang]/lab`, `/[lang]/life`, `/[lang]/about`, `/[lang]/contact`
- âœ… Set up automatic redirects from old routes (`/life` â†’ `/en/life`)
- âœ… Fixed content collection schema and file structure conflicts
- âœ… Updated PageLayout to use locale-aware navigation data
- âœ… All major routing issues resolved - navigation now works correctly!

**Test Status:** âœ… WORKING
- Navigation links correctly show translated text (Books â†’ "BÃ¼cher" in German)
- Clicking navigation items redirects to proper language URLs (`/de/life`)
- Content sections now load with language-specific filtering
- Server redirects work correctly for backward compatibility

## Planning
- [x] Analyze requirements and repo for reusable components
- [x] List existing components and layouts
- [x] Create planning, design, and implementation docs
