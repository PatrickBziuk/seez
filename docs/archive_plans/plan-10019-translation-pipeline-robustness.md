# Plan-10019: Translation Pipeline Robustness & Progressive State Saving

## Overview

Enhance the translation pipeline to be more robust, save state progressively, and implement intelligent content filtering to avoid translating components and technical elements that should remain unchanged.

## Goals

1. **Progressive State Saving**: Process translations one by one and commit after each successful translation to avoid losing work
2. **Smart Content Filtering**: Only translate title and content, preserve MDX components, code blocks, and technical elements
3. **Content-Only Processing**: Only check actual content files, skip configuration and other non-content files
4. **Tag Preservation**: Don't translate tags array - keep them in original language
5. **Hallucination Detection**: Compare original and translated content to detect AI hallucinations
6. **Incremental Commits**: Create commits after each translation to save progress

## ✅ Implementation Status - FULLY COMPLETED

### ✅ Phase 1: Content Filtering & Smart Translation

- [x] **T19-001**: Implement content-only file filtering (only src/content/{books,projects,lab,life}/)
- [x] **T19-002**: Add MDX component detection and preservation during translation
- [x] **T19-003**: Implement tag preservation logic (don't translate tags array)
- [x] **T19-004**: Create content extraction that separates translatable from non-translatable content

### ✅ Phase 2: Progressive State Saving

- [x] **T19-005**: Modify generation script to process translations sequentially instead of in batch
- [x] **T19-006**: Add git commit after each successful translation
- [x] **T19-007**: Implement resume capability - detect already translated files and skip them
- [x] **T19-008**: Add progress tracking and logging for long-running translation jobs

### ✅ Phase 3: Hallucination Detection

- [x] **T19-009**: Implement content similarity comparison between original and translated content
- [x] **T19-010**: Add semantic structure validation (headings, lists, links preserved)
- [x] **T19-011**: Create hallucination scoring and automatic rejection for poor translations
- [x] **T19-012**: Add human review flags for translations that fail hallucination checks

### ✅ Phase 4: Workflow Integration (COMPLETED)

- [x] **T19-013**: Update GitHub Actions to handle incremental commits properly
- [x] **T19-014**: Add branch protection to preserve partial translation work
- [x] **T19-015**: Implement translation job resumption on workflow restart
- [x] **T19-016**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Progressive State Saving

- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks processed one by one instead of in parallel batches
- **Incremental Commits**: Each successful translation creates a git commit immediately
- **Resume Capability**: Tracks completed tasks in `.translation-progress.json` and skips already processed translations
- **Progress Logging**: Comprehensive logging with task counters and success/failure tracking

### 2. Smart Content Filtering

- **MDX Component Preservation**: Detects and preserves React components, import statements, and technical elements
- **Placeholder System**: Uses `__PRESERVED_X__` placeholders during translation and restores afterwards
- **Tag Preservation**: Original language tags are preserved, not translated
- **Content-Only Translation**: Only title and human-readable content are sent to AI for translation

### 3. Hallucination Detection

- **Structural Analysis**: Compares heading counts, code blocks, and links between original and translated content
- **Length Ratio Analysis**: Flags translations that are suspiciously longer (>1.5x) or shorter (<0.5x) than original
- **Quality Scoring**: Generates similarity scores and automatically rejects poor translations
- **GitHub Issue Creation**: Creates issues for detected hallucinations with detailed analysis

### 4. Robust Error Handling

- **Cache System**: Avoids redundant OpenAI calls by caching successful translations
- **Quality Thresholds**: Configurable quality thresholds with automatic issue creation
- **Graceful Failures**: Individual task failures don't stop the entire pipeline
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting and progress summaries

### 5. GitHub Actions Integration (NEW)

- **Incremental Commits**: Workflow now supports the script's progressive commit feature
- **Branch Resumption**: Deterministic branch naming allows resuming interrupted jobs
- **Progress Preservation**: Failed jobs preserve all completed work in a protected branch
- **PR Management**: Automatically creates or updates PRs with translation progress
- **Error Recovery**: Creates GitHub issues for manual intervention when jobs fail

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow Changes

- **Removed**: Redundant `create-translation-pr` job that conflicted with incremental commits
- **Updated**: Branch naming from timestamp-based to commit-SHA-based for resumption
- **Added**: Git configuration moved to generation job for incremental commits
- **Enhanced**: Error handling with automatic issue creation for failed jobs
- **Improved**: PR creation/update logic within the main generation job

### Branch Management

```yaml
# Old approach (timestamp-based, no resumption)
branch_name="translate/ai-translations-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)-${commit_sha}"

# New approach (deterministic, resumption-friendly)
branch_name="translate/ai-translations-${short_sha}"
```

### Progressive Workflow Features

- **Job Resumption**: Checks for existing branches and resumes from last state
- **Incremental Push**: Pushes commits as they're created by the script
- **PR Updates**: Updates existing PRs instead of creating duplicates
- **Failure Recovery**: Preserves partial work and creates recovery instructions

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Content Filtering Patterns

````typescript
const MDX_COMPONENT_PATTERNS = [
  /<[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\s*[^>]*>/g, // Component opening tags
  /<\/[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*>/g, // Component closing tags
  /import\s+.*\s+from\s+['"][^'"]+['"];?/g, // Import statements
  /```[\s\S]*?```/g, // Code blocks
  /`[^`]+`/g, // Inline code
  /\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g, // Links (preserve URLs)
];
````

### Hallucination Detection Logic

- **Heading Count Comparison**: -20 points for mismatched heading counts
- **Code Block Preservation**: -15 points for missing/extra code blocks
- **Link Preservation**: -10 points for missing/extra links
- **Length Analysis**: -25 points for excessive length differences
- **Hallucination Threshold**: Score < 60 or > 2 issues = hallucination

### Progress Tracking Structure

```typescript
interface TranslationProgress {
  processedTasks: string[]; // Task IDs already completed
  lastProcessedTime: string; // ISO timestamp of last completion
  totalTasks: number; // Total number of tasks
  completedTasks: number; // Number of completed tasks
}
```

## 🔧 Usage and Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `TRANSLATION_QUALITY_THRESHOLD`: Minimum quality score (default: 70)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI translation

### File Structure

- `.translation-cache/`: Cached OpenAI responses
- `.translation-progress.json`: Progress tracking file
- `scripts/generate_translations.ts`: Main translation script

### Command Usage

```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate_translations.ts tasks.json
```

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

1. **Work Preservation**: No more lost translation work due to interruptions
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Cached responses avoid redundant OpenAI calls
3. **Quality Assurance**: Automatic detection of translation issues
4. **Component Safety**: MDX components and technical elements remain functional
5. **Resume Capability**: Can restart interrupted translation jobs seamlessly
6. **Incremental Progress**: Each successful translation is immediately saved
7. **Workflow Integration**: GitHub Actions fully supports progressive state saving
8. **Error Recovery**: Automatic issue creation and manual recovery instructions
