# Plan-10019: Translation Pipeline Robustness & Progressive State Saving

## Overview
Enhance the translation pipeline to be more robust, save state progressively, and implement intelligent content filtering to avoid translating components and technical elements that should remain unchanged.

## Goals
1. **Progressive State Saving**: Process translations one by one and commit after each successful translation to avoid losing work
2. **Smart Content Filtering**: Only translate title and content, preserve MDX components, code blocks, and technical elements
3. **Content-Only Processing**: Only check actual content files, skip configuration and other non-content files
4. **Tag Preservation**: Don't translate tags array - keep them in original language
5. **Hallucination Detection**: Compare original and translated content to detect AI hallucinations
6. **Incremental Commits**: Create commits after each translation to save progress

## ✅ Implementation Status - COMPLETED

### ✅ Phase 1: Content Filtering & Smart Translation
- [x] **T19-001**: Implement content-only file filtering (only src/content/{books,projects,lab,life}/)
- [x] **T19-002**: Add MDX component detection and preservation during translation
- [x] **T19-003**: Implement tag preservation logic (don't translate tags array)
- [x] **T19-004**: Create content extraction that separates translatable from non-translatable content

### ✅ Phase 2: Progressive State Saving
- [x] **T19-005**: Modify generation script to process translations sequentially instead of in batch
- [x] **T19-006**: Add git commit after each successful translation
- [x] **T19-007**: Implement resume capability - detect already translated files and skip them
- [x] **T19-008**: Add progress tracking and logging for long-running translation jobs

### ✅ Phase 3: Hallucination Detection
- [x] **T19-009**: Implement content similarity comparison between original and translated content
- [x] **T19-010**: Add semantic structure validation (headings, lists, links preserved)
- [x] **T19-011**: Create hallucination scoring and automatic rejection for poor translations
- [x] **T19-012**: Add human review flags for translations that fail hallucination checks

### 🔄 Phase 4: Workflow Integration (Remaining Tasks)
- [ ] **T19-013**: Update GitHub Actions to handle incremental commits properly
- [ ] **T19-014**: Add branch protection to preserve partial translation work
- [ ] **T19-015**: Implement translation job resumption on workflow restart
- [ ] **T19-016**: Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Progressive State Saving
- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks processed one by one instead of in parallel batches
- **Incremental Commits**: Each successful translation creates a git commit immediately
- **Resume Capability**: Tracks completed tasks in `.translation-progress.json` and skips already processed translations
- **Progress Logging**: Comprehensive logging with task counters and success/failure tracking

### 2. Smart Content Filtering
- **MDX Component Preservation**: Detects and preserves React components, import statements, and technical elements
- **Placeholder System**: Uses `__PRESERVED_X__` placeholders during translation and restores afterwards
- **Tag Preservation**: Original language tags are preserved, not translated
- **Content-Only Translation**: Only title and human-readable content are sent to AI for translation

### 3. Hallucination Detection
- **Structural Analysis**: Compares heading counts, code blocks, and links between original and translated content
- **Length Ratio Analysis**: Flags translations that are suspiciously longer (>1.5x) or shorter (<0.5x) than original
- **Quality Scoring**: Generates similarity scores and automatically rejects poor translations
- **GitHub Issue Creation**: Creates issues for detected hallucinations with detailed analysis

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- **Cache System**: Avoids redundant OpenAI calls by caching successful translations
- **Quality Thresholds**: Configurable quality thresholds with automatic issue creation
- **Graceful Failures**: Individual task failures don't stop the entire pipeline
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive error reporting and progress summaries

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Content Filtering Patterns
```typescript
const MDX_COMPONENT_PATTERNS = [
  /<[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*\s*[^>]*>/g,  // Component opening tags
  /<\/[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*>/g,        // Component closing tags
  /import\s+.*\s+from\s+['"][^'"]+['"];?/g, // Import statements
  /```[\s\S]*?```/g,                // Code blocks
  /`[^`]+`/g,                       // Inline code
  /\[([^\]]+)\]\(([^)]+)\)/g        // Links (preserve URLs)
];
```

### Hallucination Detection Logic
- **Heading Count Comparison**: -20 points for mismatched heading counts
- **Code Block Preservation**: -15 points for missing/extra code blocks
- **Link Preservation**: -10 points for missing/extra links
- **Length Analysis**: -25 points for excessive length differences
- **Hallucination Threshold**: Score < 60 or > 2 issues = hallucination

### Progress Tracking Structure
```typescript
interface TranslationProgress {
  processedTasks: string[];        // Task IDs already completed
  lastProcessedTime: string;       // ISO timestamp of last completion
  totalTasks: number;              // Total number of tasks
  completedTasks: number;          // Number of completed tasks
}
```

## 🔧 Usage and Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `TRANSLATION_QUALITY_THRESHOLD`: Minimum quality score (default: 70)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI translation

### File Structure
- `.translation-cache/`: Cached OpenAI responses
- `.translation-progress.json`: Progress tracking file
- `scripts/generate_translations.ts`: Main translation script

### Command Usage
```bash
npx tsx scripts/generate_translations.ts tasks.json
```

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

1. **Work Preservation**: No more lost translation work due to interruptions
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Cached responses avoid redundant OpenAI calls
3. **Quality Assurance**: Automatic detection of translation issues
4. **Component Safety**: MDX components and technical elements remain functional
5. **Resume Capability**: Can restart interrupted translation jobs seamlessly
6. **Incremental Progress**: Each successful translation is immediately saved

## 🚀 Next Steps

The core robustness features are complete. Remaining work focuses on workflow integration:

1. **GitHub Actions Updates**: Modify workflows to handle incremental commits
2. **Branch Management**: Implement branch protection for partial work
3. **Job Resumption**: Add workflow restart capabilities
4. **Error Recovery**: Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms

## 📝 Success Criteria - ✅ MET

- ✅ Translation pipeline can be interrupted and resumed without losing work
- ✅ MDX components and code blocks remain untranslated
- ✅ Tags are preserved in original language
- ✅ Hallucinations are detected and flagged
- ✅ Each translation creates an incremental commit
- ✅ Only actual content files are processed

**Status**: 🎯 **CORE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Major robustness improvements successfully implemented!
